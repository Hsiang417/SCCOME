# SCCOME: Scene Change Capture and Optical Motion Estimation for Video Quality Assessment

This repository contains the official implementation of **SCCOME**, a no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) framework that incorporates scene change detection, optical flow-based motion analysis, and multi-modal feature fusion.

## 📦 Environment Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have PyTorch (with GPU support) installed.

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

The pipeline is divided into three main stages:

### 1. Dataset Info Extraction

Use scripts in the `data/` folder to extract metadata (e.g., frame counts, labels, and max sequence length) for each dataset:

```bash
python data/Kon.m                 # for KoNViD-1k
python data/CVD2014.m             # for CVD2014
python data/LIVE_Qualcomm.m       # for LIVE-Qualcomm
```

This will generate `.mat` files like `KoNViD-1kinfo.mat` containing index lists and normalization parameters.

---

### 2. Feature Extraction

Extract spatial-temporal features using:

```bash
python SCCOME extract.py --database KoNViD-1k
```

Extracted features will be saved as `.npy` files in `CNN_features_{dataset}` folders, with filenames like:

```
{id}SCCOME.npy
```

These represent RGB-Canny merged features combined with optical flow and ConvNeXt + 3D statistics.

---

### 3. Quality Score Prediction
When training, the FD-VQA_test program is used to test the prediction score using the model with the best validation score. If you need to adjust the training ratio, you can adjust it in args.
Run training and evaluation:

```bash
python SCCOME test.py --database KoNViD-1k --exp_id 0
```

Key arguments:

- `--cross Y` for cross-dataset testing

- `--epochs`, `--batch_size`, `--lr` for training control

Checkpoints and results will be saved to:

- `models/`
- `results/`
